## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies if you wanna run it locally.

```bash
cd weather-app-2
npm i
```

## Usage

Type any city or country and you'll get a card that shows the maximum and minimum temperature of that day, if you click the card you get more details.
On the search bar click clear to get rid of all the cards
